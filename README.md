*   **Window manager**: [AeroSpace]

[macOS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS

**Why** I use:

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

1.  **hardware integration**

    I want a hardware-optimized desktop operating system that works out of the
    box. This allows me to be productive from day one instead of spending
    time troubleshooting hardware compatibility. Thus no fragmented ones like
    [Linux distributions].

1.  **UNIX compatibility**

    I want a Unix-based desktop operating system that provides native Unix
    functionality without virtualization. This allows me to use familiar
    commands and tools from server environments. Thus no non-Unix ones like
    [Windows] requiring virtualization.

1.  **tiled layout**

    I want a tiling window manager that automatically organizes windows into
    non-overlapping tiles. This allows me to see all open applications at once
    and it naturally encourages me to organize them into multiple workspaces.
    Thus no floating ones like the built-in macOS window manager, even with
    snapping tools like [Magnet] or [Rectangle].

1.  **i3 paradigm**

    I want an i3-like window manager that provides keyboard bindings, true
    workspaces (not macOS Spaces), and multi-monitor setup. This allows me to
    use the same workflow I had on a Linux desktop using the i3 window manager.
    Thus no non-i3 ones like [Amethyst] or [Yabai].
