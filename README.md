*   **Operating system**: [macOS]

**Why** I use:

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

1.  **hardware integration**

    I want a hardware-optimized desktop operating system that works out of the
    box. This allows me to be productive from day one instead of spending
    time troubleshooting hardware compatibility. Thus no fragmented ones like
    [Linux distributions].

1.  **UNIX compatibility**

    I want a Unix-based desktop operating system that provides native Unix
    functionality without virtualization. This allows me to use familiar
    commands and tools from server environments. Thus no non-Unix ones like
    [Windows] requiring virtualization.
